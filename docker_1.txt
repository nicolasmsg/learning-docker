** run vs start 
  docker container run ALWAYS starts a *new* container
  docker container start start an existing stopped container

** docker container run --publish 80:80 --detach --name <your name> nginx  default workflow
  Looks for that image locally in image cache
    If doesnt find : looks in remote image repository (Docker hub by default)
    Download the lastest version
  create a new container based on that image and prepares to start
  Gives a virtual IP on a private network inside docker engine
  Opens up port 80 on host and forward to port 80 in container
  Starts container by using the CMD in the image dockerfile

** What's going on in containers
  docker container top - process list in on container
  docker container inspect - detauls of one contianer config
  docker container stats - perf stats for all containers

docker container run --publish 80:80 nginx 
  Download (if required) image 'nginx' from docker hub
  Start a new container from that image
  Open port 80 on the host IP
  Route that traffic to the container IP, port 80


docker container run --publish 80:80 --detach nginx
  Same but in daemon mode.

docker container ls -a

docker container run --publish 80:80 --detach --name <your name> nginx
